# Madi's Launcher: My Personalized Chrome Extension

Built a Chrome Extension using JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 to allow easy access to my frequently visited websites such as Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub, etc. 
Performed the above project with the motive of replicating web applications at a small level and learning more about JavaScript.
